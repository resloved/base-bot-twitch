# base-bot-twitch
Simple/Reusable python bot for [twitch.tv](twitch.tv). Meant to be expanded on as it is *very* minimal.

##Usage
CFG Requirements:

* NAME as Username
* PASS as OAuth password (Can be generated [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/))
* CHAN as the channel you would like the bot to visit

##To Note
This repo was remade becuase the previous one contained sensitive information.
